## The Problem

> 4 developers. 1 QA. 1 shared staging environment.

When Developer 1 deploys their feature, it **overwrites Developer 2's code** that QA is actively testing. Progress is lost. Bugs get confused with environments. Everyone blocks everyone else.

---

## The Solution

Every Pull Request automatically gets its own **isolated Kubernetes namespace** with a unique live URL. QA tests each feature independently. Developers never block each other. Environments are destroyed automatically when no longer needed.

## Importance & Need of This Project
# Importance & Need of This Project

## The Core Problem It Solves

Software teams lose hundreds of hours every month to a single avoidable problem — **shared staging environments**. When multiple developers deploy to the same server, they overwrite each other's work. QA starts testing a feature, a developer deploys something new, and the test session is destroyed. The cycle repeats endlessly.

This is not a small team problem. It happens at startups with 3 developers and at enterprises with 300. The bottleneck is architectural, not human.

---

## Why It Matters

**For Developers**
Every developer works in complete isolation. No coordination needed before deploying. No "hey don't push to staging, QA is testing my feature" Slack messages. No broken builds caused by someone else's code. Developer velocity increases directly because the feedback loop is shorter — push code, get a live URL in 3 minutes, iterate.

**For QA Engineers**
QA gets a dedicated, stable environment per feature. The URL never changes mid-session. No environment is shared with anyone else. QA can test 4 features simultaneously, each on its own URL, without any of them interfering. Bug reports become accurate — the bug is tied to a specific branch, a specific build, a specific environment.

**For Engineering Managers**
Release cycles become predictable. Features are tested in isolation before merge, so integration issues are caught earlier. The merge queue becomes clean — only QA-approved code gets merged. Hotfixes don't get blocked by in-progress feature testing.

**For the Business**
Faster releases mean faster delivery of value to customers. Fewer production bugs mean less downtime and better user trust. A clean CI/CD process is a competitive advantage — companies that ship faster win.

## Industry Context

This pattern is used by some of the most respected engineering teams in the world:

| Company | Their Implementation |
|---|---|
| Vercel | Built their entire product around PR preview deployments |
| Netlify | Deploy previews as a core feature |
| Shopify | Internal system called Spin — ephemeral K8s envs per PR |
| GitHub | Uses ephemeral environments for github.com development |
| Uber | Per-PR environments for microservices testing at scale |

These companies didn't build this because it was nice to have. They built it because shared staging was actively slowing them down.

---

## Why Kubernetes for This

Kubernetes namespaces are the perfect primitive for environment isolation. A namespace is a virtual cluster within a cluster — it has its own network space, its own pods, its own services. Two namespaces can run the same application on the same cluster with zero interference. When you delete a namespace, everything inside it is gone instantly. This maps perfectly to the PR lifecycle — create on open, destroy on close.

k3s makes this accessible without a managed Kubernetes bill. The same patterns that work on k3s work identically on EKS, GKE, or AKS — making this a transferable, production-grade skill.

---

## What Makes This Project Specifically Valuable

**It solves a real problem** — not a toy project, not a tutorial follow-along. A real bottleneck that real teams face daily, with a real architectural solution.

**It demonstrates systems thinking** — understanding that the problem isn't "staging is broken" but "the architecture creates contention," then designing around the contention rather than working around it.

**It combines multiple disciplines** — cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, CI/CD automation, API integration, shell scripting, permission management, network configuration. Each piece is simple, but connecting them into a working system demonstrates engineering maturity.

**It is explainable** — you can walk any interviewer through the problem, the solution, the architecture, and the tradeoffs in under 5 minutes. That clarity is rare and valuable.

---

## The Business Case in Numbers

| Metric | Shared Staging | Ephemeral Envs |
|---|---|---|
| Deployments blocked per week | 8–15 | 0 |
| QA sessions destroyed per week | 4–8 | 0 |
| Time lost to environment conflicts | 3–5 hours/developer/week | ~0 |
| Environments available simultaneously | 1 | Unlimited |
| Cost of this system | ~$0.09/hour | Same |

The cost of the infrastructure is negligible compared to the developer time saved.

## How It Works — Step by Step

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Developer opens a PR or pushes to a branch |
| 2 | Jenkins detects the change via GitHub polling |
| 3 | Fresh Docker image built from latest code |
| 4 | Image imported into k3s container runtime |
| 5 | New Kubernetes namespace `pr-{n}` created |
| 6 | App deployed inside isolated namespace |
| 7 | NodePort service exposes app on unique port |
| 8 | Jenkins posts live URL on GitHub PR via API |
| 9 | QA tests at unique URL — zero interference |
| 10 | Old namespaces destroyed automatically |

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Cloud | AWS EC2 (c7i-flex.large) | Host the entire system |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes (k3s) | Run isolated environments |

## Pipeline Stages

```
Clone Repo → Build Image → Import to k3s → Create Namespace
     → Deploy → Print URL → Comment on PR → Cleanup
```

### Jenkinsfile Overview

```groovy
pipeline {
    environment {
        NAMESPACE = "pr-${BUILD_NUMBER}"  // isolated per build
        IMAGE_TAG = "v${BUILD_NUMBER}"    // versioned image
    }
    stages {
        stage('Clone Repo')      { ... } // pull latest code
        stage('Build Image')     { ... } // docker build
        stage('Import to k3s')   { ... } // load into containerd
        stage('Create Namespace'){ ... } // kubectl create namespace
        stage('Deploy')          { ... } // apply k8s manifests
        stage('Print URL')       { ... } // echo live URL
        stage('Comment on PR')   { ... } // post to GitHub API
    }
    post {
        always { ... } // auto-destroy old namespaces
    }
}
```

## Key Features

### 🔒 Namespace Isolation
Each build gets its own `pr-{n}` namespace. Completely isolated — different IP space, different pods, different service ports. Dev 1 and Dev 2 can deploy simultaneously with zero conflict.

### ⚡ Auto-Deploy
Jenkins polls GitHub every 2 minutes. Any new commit triggers the full pipeline automatically. No manual button clicking.

### 🗑️ Auto-Destroy
Previous namespaces are deleted at the end of every build. Only the latest environment stays alive. No stale environments accumulating.

### 💬 PR Comments
Jenkins calls the GitHub API to post the live preview URL directly on the open PR. QA knows exactly where to test without asking anyone.

### 🔄 Permission Persistence
Custom systemd services (`k3s-permissions.service`, `k3s-kubeconfig.service`) ensure k3s permissions survive server restarts automatically.

---

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu 22.04+, minimum 2 vCPU / 4GB RAM)
- Docker installed
- Jenkins installed and running
- GitHub repository

### 1. Install k3s

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
sudo chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

### 2. Give Jenkins access to k3s

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins
sudo chmod 666 /run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/jenkins/.kube
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml /var/lib/jenkins/.kube/config
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.kube
```

### 3. Set up permission persistence

```bash
# Create systemd service for kubeconfig permissions
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/k3s-kubeconfig.service
# Add service that runs: chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml

# Create systemd service for containerd socket
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/k3s-permissions.service
# Add service that runs: chmod 666 /run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable k3s-kubeconfig.service k3s-permissions.service
```

### 4. Add Jenkins Credentials

Go to **Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Credentials → System → Global**

Add a **Secret text** credential:
- ID: `pr-comment`
- Secret: your GitHub Personal Access Token (needs `repo` scope)

### 5. Create Jenkins Pipeline

- New Item → Pipeline
- Build Triggers: Poll SCM → `H/2 * * * *`
- Pipeline: paste contents of `Jenkinsfile`
- GitHub Project URL: your repo URL
